# TravelBuckeList

I developed this app to practice some skills of working with __swiftUI__ and __Realm__. I also used here __Clean Swift architecture__.
Idea of this app is very simple, it's “travel bucket list”, it works kinda same as to-do list, except you can’t mark item as “done”. App supports data storage using Realm, of course you can delete, add and rearrange items in you list. Also you can edit them.
